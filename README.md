# Grid-Connected-Cascaded-H-Bridge-Converter
Simulation of Cascaded H-Bridge (CHB) Converter for STATCOM and Active Rectifier Application
– Designed a five-level CHB Voltage Source Converter using two cells per leg.
– Implemented vector control via abc–dq0 transformation to independently control active and reactive power.
– Regulated Id current to control DC-link voltage, ensuring capacitor stability in STATCOM and rectifier modes.
– Applied carrier rotation-based sorting to balance switching frequency across cells.
